<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

Most math account sites have two problems, the first is that almost all just displays the result and is over, does not show the account resolution to the user, and whoever is a student knows how harmful this is to their knowledge, because We were able to acquire no knowledge just by informing the coefficients and visualizing the result. The second factor is that the sites are ugly in terms of design, and confusing, I was looking at the sites they had about it and the button to perform the calculation was a <p> </p> tag, not intuitive ...
Because of this need for good and useful math account websites, the idea for MathBrain came up. And this project fell like a glove in my hands, because I wanted to start using TypeScript, and what is better to test a language like TS if not an application that has to deal with several functions that return and receive different types of types .
This project was also very intuitive to be able to put into practice everything I had studied in the book Clean Code, small functions, DRY, clear names, just a responsibility for function ...
